This is a custom plugin with a custom Plupload Drag & Drop uploader with WordPress. You can use this example code into your custom plugin or themes. It's generally useful when you have frontend bulk upload and you don't wanna use WordPress Media Library for bulk upload and wanna go with your upload method using chuck system.

### Installation
Download the plugin repo zip and install in your WordPress website. If you don't know how to style plugin manually on WordPress website, then [instructions how to install plugin manully available here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

### How to use
After installing and activating the plugin on your website, Create a new page from your backend and put this **[plupload_wordpress_uploader]** shortcode on that page editor and publish the page and view the page. You'll see the drag and drag uploader.

That's it.
